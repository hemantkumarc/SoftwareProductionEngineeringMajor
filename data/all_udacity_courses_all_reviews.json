Definitely worth it. Not to mention free elective courses for people who need to build a good foundation.   Thank you for the amazing projects and the teachers were great.

This project addresses exactly my field of interest (without deviating to less relevant topics), however, some more features allowing hints or short videos going into the many various ways how to solve actively a problem would be helpful.   I've learned that there are so many ways to solve a problem... but could you provide various videos with alternative approaches...the hints are great...but something that would show how you actively try to solve something and how small changes impact the whole code might help. (you've did it in one video which was really great)  I've had to submit my project 7 times - some of your reviewers were of great help and gave amazing feedback with visuals...thank you so much and you kept me going...but others were very brief which was frustrating and I almost wanted to quit and look for an alternative platform."

During the process of completing my modules, I ran into several bugs in the provided modules.  I found this very irritating, but a friend pointed out that perhaps the bugs in the provided modules were part of the process.  I would suggest that if that was indeed the intention, that you indicate that for others so they can be prepared.  Next, write a concise and clear specification and have the teaching occur someplace else.

I submitted my project exactly using the template given and received a failing grade. It seems that I missed a sentence in the rubric asking that questions and answers be submitted as well.

However, I was disappointed that the course so far has not covered the practice of using slowly changing dimensions...I hope that this will be covered later. It was also unclear why the projects table template did not use prefixes of DIMN_% and FACT_% to help differentiate the types of tables and therefore the data modeling methodology that they belonged... is this no longer a good practice?   I am now delving in the NoSQL Cassandra data modelling space which is new territory for me. I am very much looking forward to what learning I have ahead of me here."

In my case, it turned out that the project went faster when I reduced the usage of Jupiter Notebooks and moved everything to VSCode, which is my preferred coding editor.  4. I also missed the possibility of working with real word data, but that is the same case as point 2, there would be way more data and it would also lead to a heavy usage of storage or bandwich in Udacity servers. 5.

I have recently had very ugly experiences that looked like failures. There has been a chain of responses from people who have reasons to say that I didn't perform well in the activities and attempts I got involved in, including academic activities and job interviews. On one hand I am honestly  thoroughly downcast. So when I started this Udacity program, one mind kept telling me that I would also receive same responses from my reviewers. But after the assessment of my first project, surprisingly for the first time in many months, the reviewer gave me a positive feedback. So the big question in my mind is, where has my problem come from, all this while? I can't even provide the answer because the Udacity reviewer did an honest review of my work without a special favor to me. Could it be sheer hard luck working aganst me all this while?  Well, I am still continuing with the rest of the program modules and I pray I continue to do well or even better. It has been an interesting and challanging program and it is worth doing, all the same. I have really learnt and been challanged a lot. I would always recommend Udacity programs to people. They are information-packed and knowledge-full. The hands-on mode of teaching makes it even more interesting, as the student confirms every tid bit on his own. Kudos to the Udacity team!"

The mentors have been super-quick in responding to questions in 'Knowledge', and the review for my first project was also informative and came back within a couple of hours of submission.

The mentor help section is of great help because, you see questions to similar problems you have, even if you don't find answer, ask a question an a mentor helps immediately, that's nice.

Often times, the mentors left the solution on how to solve the problem, but seem to lack the explanation as to what the cause for the errors are."

        "description": "The UX Fundamentals & Design Research program teaches the core principles of human-centered design, including scoping a design problem, conducting in-depth interviews, creating quantitative surveys, using research data to uncover opportunities, and applying psychology to design sketches with the end user in mind. Participants will learn how to develop a discussion guide, recruit research participants, and synthesize findings in the form of a research report. They will also learn how to translate research findings into low-fidelity prototypes that can be tested with users, design high-fidelity prototypes, and conduct usability tests. Finally, the program teaches advanced user interface principles to build interactive designs that engage users and improve key performance indicators.",

The architecture of the curriculum helps to guide the students of the ux program through design sprints, processes, and methodologies similarly to that in real world scenarios. I'd appreciate including other worldly-like scenarios where the student has to design based on a given topic, such as an icon to help build a design system or to provide a product such as a website that needs a redesign and the student has 1-1 sessions with a mentor (or the like) to act as stakeholders, who grade the student on the discovery questions, design, presentation, workshops, etc. A more collaborative, hands-on approach to earning the degree."

I did a few UX courses on other websites before learning with Udacity (some had only videos, some had videos+texts+quiz), however, Udacity offered me valuable & quality knowledge, short quizzes along the way, and projects to work on, as well as helpful & quick project feedback from the reviewers. That gives me more confidence in UX!  However, I believe I spend more than 10 hours per week on projects, which is fine with me. I hope to work as a user experience designer in the future!  If I, a teenager speaking English as a second language, can accomplish it, I believe you can do it as well :)"

My only reservations are with the code-along walkthroughs, for three reasons:  The copy hasn't been reviewed well enough, and I've found misspellings in comments and small bugs in print statements. Easy to fix, but doesn't look great.  Secondly, I'd appreciate slightly more freedom in how to go about solving various problems, rather than the 'write this line of code, then this one' approach. In other courses I've done (General Assembly's Data Science Immersive, Harvard's CS50) the emphasis is more on introducing a package or coding paradigm thoroughly, before letting you solve the problem how you want to.  I fully support giving people some boilerplate code after they've finished a task that details the best approach, but this would be more effective after they've tried struggling along with their own methods and can therefore understand why the model answer is better.  Following on from this, I think more attention could be paid to introducing & explaining the packages used. I've had a lot of experience with scikit-learn and statsmodels, but pomegranate is completely new to me. My learning was hindered by the lack of explanation of the attributes and methods provided with the various class objects (e.g. what bake() does), and given the pomegranate docs aren't as thorough as sklearn, I would have appreciated more help from Udacity.  That said, I still feel like I'm getting my money's worth and am ready to continue!"

Though I found good resources on the internet, I was expecting more on computer science topics behind AWS. Eg. An optional lesson on CDN, VPC, DNS, Subnets.  I felt a need for more visual diagrams to clarify the big picture. Maybe diagrams to explain why and what of the problem at the start of a lesson and an AWS architecture diagram i.e. how at the end. This will act as a ready reckoner mnemonic tool.  Overall, I am happy I took the NanoDegree and looking forward to learning more and using the skills to develop AWS-ome products."

Or is it some misunderstanding from me? (For those not in the program: You lack some rights for certain required actions using the Udacity console).  Maybe you have to check the projects with the settings we students have. The real issue is that if you do this training in parallel to your full time job, its the time you loose, just to find out by hints in the forum, that you have to redo the setup again in your own AWS account (which by the way is limited in budget).

While learning from books and other outside sources is great, the fact that I spend 5x as long in the outside sources learning as I get in the content I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m paying for is indicative that there is simply not enough information here.

The first project took me a long time because I purposefully tried to implement it without being too close to the reference implementations in exercises leading up to it thinking it would help me really drill in the material, and I think it was good for me, but to finish  the nanodegree on time I may stick closer to recommended approaches in future assignments."

I think it would be more beneficial to maybe find a way to teach students how to get about such issues without forcing a change in OS or program version, if possible. Thank you."

The description under the videos is confusing: should I do what the video suggests? 3. The project instruction about the Proposal.pdf was not clear. I didn't get from the 1st time that I must fill the template instead of writing my own document. 4. The 2 attempts of the project mostly were rejected due to the technical issue with saving the Preview page and I actually could not get it to work properly. I must provide the video with an explanation of the issue and why I cannot satisfy all the reviewers.

I was shocked at how good concepts were explained. It doesn't delve too deep into the mathematics but does give the student enough to on his own and read more advanced books and progress.

It is something drastically different than a standard SW engineer job, where you have to do a lot more design and manual implementation.

I think that Malavica's work should be redone by Ziad.  Compared to Ziad's work, hers looks to be amaturish and lazy.  Her work is nothing but powerpoints (with errors at that), and uses a 16 record table.  Her work does not seem as professional as Ziad's, or even Derek's.

This design is good. I can stop learning anywhere in a lesson and easy to continue to learning in the lesson when i'm back.  cons: 1. my feeling is the course doesn't cover much details about several supervised learning topics. It can be used as a guideline and i need to learn from other sources (from internet or machine learning books) to have a better understanding about the topics. Or probably the course encourages student to learn from external sources. That's a good practice for senior learners in ML, but it really takes much time and sometimes costs confusion about the concepts for a beginner to learn from external sources. Overall, I think this course still helps me to learn machine learning on entry level and the mentors helps a lot."

However Udacity evidently goes beyond this limit by being any module with ideas of 'how would you design a KPI' or 'describe a goal' for online education companies. Far beyond the limit of acceptable being a process of mutual exchange without problems however sucking the student to the maximum does not make sense. The Platform lost a lot of points with me"

On the plus side, I have found it very helpful and adding to my skills I have already gained through my job experiences with Power BI desktop. An enhancement I would suggest is to demo the handling of uploading the individual dimension tables for the star schema versus a single table upload from a custom view (such as from a SQL server environment). I've run into this latter situation in a recent work contract. The single view gave me some interesting challenges on the DAX side for formulas. On the negative side, I have none really. The program develops your confidence in using the application and building small star schema/ data mart/data models in PBI. I will say that if you have used Power Pivot when they were simple add-ins to Excel and modeled in Excel, you will find the beginning a bit of a refresher. And the only real critique I have is that I would have liked to have more practice (or at least demoed!) loading data into power bi desktop not just from individual files but from other sources - simulating a corporate environment if that was possible."

I know that the cost of having experts help out and evaluate our work is hard to balance (and again! very helpful and awesome!) but we are not paing $50 or $100 for the course, we are paing much more and a little difference between the paid and free course should be other videos with different approaches of the problems with different apps. The ones i did for free i thought it was to be in the same level of knowledge to be able to do the nanodegree, it happens that the joint of the free courses ARE the nanodegree aside the personal projects. It could be a 5 star! And if anyone that  reads this thinks i'm beeing too greedy, please take that in consideration and read it as a 5 star review!"

Anyway, it is worth it if you can afford to pay for the course, because it is also true that, for people like me who are students and residents in Mexico, it is expensive.

The project was also a nice break from constant learning and instead practical implementation of my new skills. I would also like to applaud the help the mentors give to the students and the feedback my project reviewer gave due to the fact I singed up for this course because it is hard learning a skill where no one around you is knowledgeable in the field.

When I would log off, after submitting, the mentor posted pictures of my code in a previous state, without adjustments made but, in fact, I had made those corrections in the project workspace. I recall running pycodestyle on the files and remembering it didn't pick up on immediate changes (within 1-2 minutes), I would have to wait about 2 minutes to run pycodestyle again. I reported a ticket with support however, they could not assist.   I found the NEO project to be fascinating and would have very much preferred to have learned or gone more in depth to the structure of main.py and overall how the project was setup. Most of it was setup by Udacity but, in fact, as a student I would have benefited from learning that aspect as well."

While working on the project, I encountered some quite difficult things like starting to define the database component format and linking the two classes together, handling the filter and query part. With the first data binding it was quite confusing for me so I failed a lot of tests on the first submit, but actually the second time doing it actually looking back it was really simple. The filter creation did not follow the instructions, I needed to add a variable to make it easier to determine the value to compare from the database. With testing the program, I often fail and error because defining the wrong input variable data format makes the output different than expected. Those are some of my experiences when working on this project, after working with the mentor's project helped me better understand some knowledge and some experience when programming a project in python."

Like, for example, the fact that we are instructed to decide ourselves on the topic names, but the consumer topic names are hardcoded in the `server.py`, so we either change them there, too, or we have to use those exact names."

            },
            {
                "content": "The good: I got through the first part of the Udacity Data Analysis course.  Then I started working, and I did not see the value added of doing the second part of the course.  I felt that I was competent for Data Analysis Python.  I first learned programming in 1991 with Pascal and Ingres.  At that time, you had to build your own modules and functions. These days open source offers many possibilities to use already built functions and classes.  But open source documentation is a challenge.  At work, I am a SQL Data Engineering System Analyst.  My team has great best practices using Kimball in Sybase.   I feel like I am an SQL native and I translate into Python, but frequently I use Udacity Python less to translate into Sybase SQL. SQL is not what it was in 1991 - there are more possibilities.   I had an understanding of object oriented programming, but did not have even academic experience.  At work, we have built using Sybase Data Service what I think of as object oriented SQL - I think the project will help be better understand development as needed - I am so busy that I cannot get down to programming details - and I have great colleagues.  We will also be changing technical platforms so the Object oriented experience will help.  Learning Kafka basics, of course is great. An added bonus was learning basic JSON. It took extra effort, but it was good to challenge learning new things.  The framework is a great example of decoupled architecture.  I had never programmed  in a Linux/Unix so the Udacity workspace is a great.   I think Udacity has always been good with project reviews, but I think the Data Streaming is even better. They hold Udacity standards, but also teach.   To improve:  At work we have a framework that we work with.  The general rule is the developer needs to add his SQL to the framework.   The developer cannot change the framework without the express consent of the Lead Developer - if a developer does this he/she will not be in the team for long.  In the Project directions, we had incomplete instructions.  We had to change the framework for the project to work.  For me it was challenging, but it is not good practice to change frameworks (e.g. server.py, producer.line.py)   I have noted that in the internet documentation and also in the Udacity course, the examples are not end to end - or  very rarely.  If I would want to be a python/kafka  professional programmer, I would add end to end examples to the documentation - but work comes first. In the Data Analysis course, I had a bigger challenge with renewing or fully understanding statistics - Udacity also taught this very well.  But I thought the Data Analysis  lectures were more end to end then  Data Streaming lectures in the first part of the course.   On the whole the Udacity workspace is great.  But there are sometimes infrastructure problems - there were 2 days of macro problems.  But 1-2 times a week there would be micro problems.  In the start, I thought my software was the problem, but I got to now that there were infrastructure problems.   In the Data Analysis course, Udacity tried to organize meeting with mentors.  This did not work.  It would be nice if you could request a meeting - e.g. x minutes of requested meeting in a project.   Sometimes going through mentor responses is like stackoverflow, sometimes the response are quite helpful - I am really thankful for the help I got for producer.weather.py - turns out with a typing error in topic name you will not get a python or kafka error.   Conclusion:  My goal is to be a well rounded Data professional.   At work, our business want to use more data streaming.  I have noticed that there are not many who understand SQL Data Engineering and Data Streaming.  The course is taking more effort then expected, but I feel that I am reaching that goal."

        "description": "The AI for Healthcare program offers two courses that apply AI to 2D and 3D medical imaging data. The first course covers fundamental skills needed to work with 2D imaging data, such as extracting images from DICOM files, building AI models, and obtaining regulatory approval. The course project involves training a CNN to classify chest X-rays for the presence of pneumonia and writing an FDA validation plan. The second course covers 3D imaging data, including clinical fundamentals, imaging modalities, and common analysis tasks. It also explores how AI can be integrated into the clinical workflow. Both courses are designed to teach students how to derive clinically relevant insights from medical imaging data using AI.",

The first project is great as it covers the basics of a model for disease detection and the regulatory aspects of publishing a medical device. On the other hand, the second project (3d imaging) is too complex and too detailed. Made me feel I'm training to become a radiologist rather than a data scientist, that project is not helpful nor relevant for my career . I'm about to start the 3rd project and from what it looks like it is a project that will be relevant for my current job.  Overall a good program, with lots of interesting topics."

For example, it was asked to select 2 use cases and on the following survey form, 3 use cases are present which in my opinion doesn't make sense. The survey should help us to decide which of the 3 use cases we want to select to go further.

Its like living on the edge of fractal, its beautiful, its fun, but you never get to the bottom.   I felt a little lost, even dismayed. I wanted to apply AI/ML to real work and I didn't want to be playing at it.

It is slightly uneven in difficulty at times - detailed discussions of policy and standards at some point, elementary Windows configuration at other - but I didn't mind this too much. This sense may stem, in part, from the fact that I was previously in the industry and am using this to get back in practice as well as earn further credentials at my current job. And for that, the hands-on aspects are great!   Despite some minor quibbles with the details of Project 1, it was a lot of fun, and was a good excuse to dive back into the details of Windows policy, even beyond what the project required. My only real complaint here is that the document itself could use some polish and more consistent, precise language."

But besides that the course is very good, a lot of grest information and I really liked the ability to use what I am learning. What I also thought was really awesome is that at the beginning of this week I started an IT job where I am a support specialist and the things that I learned in this program I was able to directly apply at my job. My familiarity with windows and th principles of securing a PC and understanding the professional way to do it has increased tremendously. For that I say thank you."

If I had to provide some advice to students considering the Nanodegree program in Cybersecurity, it would be this:  If you are brand new to both IT and Cybersecurity, and you have a full time job, it may be best to start with some of Udacity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s individual courses to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals prior to beginning the Nanodegree program.

And there were a couple of things in the project that weren't covered in the material.  Some of the material is a little outdated (e.g. CIS now only has 18 controls vs 20).  But overall, I like it.  When first signing up, I didn't not know we would need to set up an account with Azure, nor did I know what to expect with the projects.  So maybe a little more transparency about what you are getting into when you sign up would be good."

I'd prefer 10-15min videos with more concepts and more details.  Another thing I don't like is the web experience for programming, which was always a deal breaker for me, doing stuff in your browser interface. Fortunately, the first exercise was doable by providing a git account link. Hopefully, it will stay this way."

I was really looking forward to implementing a solid testing structure after watching some additional material on testing. Things that are important for testing is that they run independently and efficiently. A model can't be retrained for testing. But the starter script suggests you retrain the model. There is little guidance on good principles for writing tests.  I really like the clean code part though. It's something I can use now as well. Some more in depth knowledge wouldn't be too bad regarding pep8 standards though. It is a further reading, but it might be good if there were a general introduction. e.g. how should class names be written, how should method names be written, etc. Some good practices in code structure etc."

Having graduated from Front End Web Developer Nanodegree, I know how challenging Udacity's programs are but the best part is, you almost get real work like development experience. I started my MEAN stack development three years back, but implemented projects with callback hell and wrote code that was not easily maintainable. But with my very first project itself, I implemented my Image Processing API with TypeScript, wrote unit tests with Jasmine and used best practices like writing my own utility middlewares, used Promises with Async/ Await and overall no spaghetti code. I'm confident this will turn me from an Intermediate Full Stack Developer to Advanced one by end of the course. Also highly recommended for Front End Developers who want to pick up Server Side skills with out favourite JavaScript. Thanks team Udacity for a wonderful course."

In the SQL course, students learn to use SQL to answer complex business problems, including basic commands, joins, and aggregations. In the R course, students learn programming fundamentals and topics such as data types, functions, loops, and conditional statements. They learn to read and manipulate data in R, create basic visualizations, and perform statistical analysis. The version control course teaches students to use Git and GitHub to manage versions of programs and collaborate with others. These courses include practical projects where students use their skills to analyze real data.",

I did not get it in the web but by chance found it in the knowledge sections. It's not the end of the world, but the information is so crucidal, it should be in the lesson! * give more dirctions with the load-balancer and how it must be done in terraform and Azure; if you are not senior in web-technology, it's hard to reason what and why resources must be created.  * the project could be more satifying if one would actually deploy a static webside and be able to see it in the browser by going to the load-balancer's public IP; I would want to see this instead of researching for the right way to define the custom image in main.tf."

Never did something like that.  I think the is potential for improvement in methods and examples which type of projects there are how much time to calculate. It was hard for me to predict scope, timeframe and costs for the projects. I would love to see some examples, to feel more comfortable with my estimations on evaluating data science projects.

If the students without basic networking knowledge will be hard to understand the VLAN, DMZ and networks setup concept, so it requires devote much more time to complete the first project. I would recommend to add basic networking knowledge as one of  prerequisites for this program or provide another basic course for networking to help those students to learn even better from Security Aanlyst program.

Along the way, you'll learn how OpenAI works and how to leverage its powerful language processing capabilities to build a functional Q&A bot that can provide insightful answers to your questions and impress your friends with its knowledge.\n\nWe'll start by creating an unsupervised machine-learning workflow to match the user's question to the relevant context in our dataset. We'll use that workflow to send a custom prompt that includes this context to an OpenAI text completion model. The output will be a custom response that is better aligned with our user's need for accurate data about recent events.",

This design is good. I can stop learning anywhere in a lesson and easy to continue to learning in the lesson when i'm back.  cons: 1. my feeling is the course doesn't cover much details about several supervised learning topics. It can be used as a guideline and i need to learn from other sources (from internet or machine learning books) to have a better understanding about the topics. Or probably the course encourages student to learn from external sources. That's a good practice for senior learners in ML, but it really takes much time and sometimes costs confusion about the concepts for a beginner to learn from external sources. Overall, I think this course still helps me to learn machine learning on entry level and the mentors helps a lot."

Different from other platforms where an introductory course is labeled as advanced this nanodegree is a comprehensive course of the topics related to finances providing also plenty of additional material for us to learn more.

Look at Andrew Nag\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s Intro to Deep Learning course. Way more videos and explains everything in a real lecture fashion. While learning from books and other outside sources is great, the fact that I spend 5x as long in the outside sources learning as I get in the content I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m paying for is indicative that there is simply not enough information here.

The first project took me a long time because I purposefully tried to implement it without being too close to the reference implementations in exercises leading up to it thinking it would help me really drill in the material, and I think it was good for me, but to finish  the nanodegree on time I may stick closer to recommended approaches in future assignments."

During the process of completing my modules, I ran into several bugs in the provided modules.  I found this very irritating, but a friend pointed out that perhaps the bugs in the provided modules were part of the process.  I would suggest that if that was indeed the intention, that you indicate that for others so they can be prepared.  Next, write a concise and clear specification and have the teaching occur someplace else.  However by this time in the course, we should be able to complete this assignment without the additional teaching, reminders and hints."

It is slightly uneven in difficulty at times - detailed discussions of policy and standards at some point, elementary Windows configuration at other - but I didn't mind this too much. This sense may stem, in part, from the fact that I was previously in the industry and am using this to get back in practice as well as earn further credentials at my current job. And for that, the hands-on aspects are great!   Despite some minor quibbles with the details of Project 1, it was a lot of fun, and was a good excuse to dive back into the details of Windows policy, even beyond what the project required. My only real complaint here is that the document itself could use some polish and more consistent, precise language."

But besides that the course is very good, a lot of grest information and I really liked the ability to use what I am learning. What I also thought was really awesome is that at the beginning of this week I started an IT job where I am a support specialist and the things that I learned in this program I was able to directly apply at my job. My familiarity with windows and th principles of securing a PC and understanding the professional way to do it has increased tremendously. For that I say thank you."

If I had to provide some advice to students considering the Nanodegree program in Cybersecurity, it would be this:  If you are brand new to both IT and Cybersecurity, and you have a full time job, it may be best to start with some of Udacity\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s individual courses to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals prior to beginning the Nanodegree program.

When first signing up, I didn't not know we would need to set up an account with Azure, nor did I know what to expect with the projects.

That gives me more confidence in UX!  However, I believe I spend more than 10 hours per week on projects, which is fine with me. I hope to work as a user experience designer in the future!
